# Churn-prediction-system

## Project Overview

Churn occurs when customers discontinue using a company's services in favor of competitors offering better services or pricing. This project aims to predict which customers are likely to churn, helping telecommunications companies to retain customers, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce revenue loss.
By identifying customers with a high likelihood of churning, companies can develop targeted retention strategies. This project analyzes key factors contributing to churn, such as network quality, customer service issues, and pricing concerns.

## Business Problem

The objective of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn and develop effective strategies to retain them. By analyzing the features that lead to churn (such as customer service calls, pricing, or plan subscriptions), the model will help the business to segment customers and craft personalized marketing and retention efforts.

## Goals:

Churn Prediction: Develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn based on their features.
Model Performance Evaluation: Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models to identify the most accurate one.
Increase Revenue: Retaining more customers will contribute to higher revenue and a stronger market position.
Feature Insights: Analyze customer features to uncover key drivers behind churn.

## Best Model:

The Random Forest Classifier performed the best, achieving:

Accuracy: 93.7%
Precision: 82%
Recall: 81.19%
F1 Score: 81.6%

##Conclusion

The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer with 93.7% accuracy and a well-balanced precision and recall.
Key Features: The most influential features in predicting churn were "customer_service_calls", "total_day_minutes", "total_day_charge", "total_intl_calls", and "total_eve_charge".

## Recommendations:
Improve Customer Service:

High customer service calls are correlated with churn. Improving customer service quality by offering better training to representatives could help reduce churn.
Evaluate Pricing Structure:

Evaluate and adjust the pricing structure for day, evening, night, and international charges. Offering discounted packages or adjustments could help address customer concerns about high charges.
Engage with Clients Likely to Churn:

Focus marketing efforts on clients with high usage, as they are more likely to churn. Offering special deals or personalized offers could improve retention.
